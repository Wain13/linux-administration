# shebang

The very first line of a script designates the interpreter the script is going to be run under. The inerpreter is launched and the rest of the script is passed into it.
The character sequence for designating the intepreter is called a **shebang** and looks like the following:
  
## #!
  
**Shell scripts must have the Read permission bit set as well as Execute**
  
e.g.

- #!/usr/bin/python
- #!bash
